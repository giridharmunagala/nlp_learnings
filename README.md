Natural language processing (NLP) is the field of understanding & building learning algorithms in text domain. 
Few of the interesting NLP tasks are 
- **Text classification**: Categorising documents & texts. Helpful in organizing documents, sentiment analysis, classifying customers etc.
- **Named Entity recognition**: Identifying & extracting useful entities from text. Ex: ppl & organizations from news data
- **Text summarization**: Condensing information from a large documents into quickly glanceable summaries
- **Machine translation**: Translating one language text into another
- **Semantic search**: Retrieving relevant documents from a given user query

Writing this repo to showcase my skills in NLP using a series of Jupyter notebooks, each providing detailed solutions for NLP problems.

Code is structured as follows
**text_classification**
- nlp-text-classification-tfidf.ipynb - TF-IDF based text classification approach
- nlp-text-classification-embeddings-classifier.ipynb - Building Skip gram embeddings
- nlp-text-classification-embeddings-classifier.ipynb - Using the trained Skip gram embeddings for text classification
- nlp-text-classifiction-transformers.ipynb - Using transformers for text classification

Many more coming soon!
